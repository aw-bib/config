# Icon theme for freedesktop.org desktops

This theme contains only a diff against the osx icon theme available
from
http://n00b-un-2.deviantart.com/art/OSX-Icon-Theme-for-Gnome-279284710 

# Installation

First install osx theme available at:

http://n00b-un-2.deviantart.com/art/OSX-Icon-Theme-for-Gnome-279284710 

Then copy the files to your .icons/-folder and run

	$ linkOSX

to set up links against the installed osx-Icon theme just installed.
Note that linkOSX will not add links for applications.

# FAQ
Do not link the app-icons to keep orignial GNOME-icons, ie. the usual
icons that come with the applications. It doesn't make sense to use
the OS-X filer icon, map LibreOffice to M$ icons and treat Gimp as
Photoshop.
